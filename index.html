					<p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The Originals is an American television series that began airing on The CW on October 3, 2013. Created as a spin-off of The Vampire Diaries, the series follows vampire-werewolf hybrid Klaus Mikaelson as he and his family become embroiled in the supernatural politics of New Orleans.</p>
					<p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">The Originals is a spin-off from The Vampire Diaries which centers around the Mikaelson siblings, Klaus (Joseph Morgan), Elijah (Daniel Gillies), and Rebekah (Claire Holt). The backdoor pilot, which aired on April 25, 2013, also revealed that the werewolf Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin) is pregnant with Klaus's child and would, therefore, join the cast. The show begins with the original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time since 1919. Having originally built the city, they had been forced to flee from their vengeful father. In their absence, Klaus's protégé, Marcel (Charles Michael Davis), took charge of the city. Klaus resolves that they must take down Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them. While doing that they must also protect their city from a war brewing between vampires, werewolves and witches. Over time new and old friendships are formed, love is in the air, death surrounds them and most of all they learn more about their own family past. The first season describes how Klaus's mystical child is going to be born and speaks of the threats that the family together must keep away from her. The second season deals with the return of Klaus' parents, and the arrival of an aunt who threatens the baby's life. The third season shows the Mikealsons facing a prophecy that speaks of their downfall, and the first sired vampires who've wanted revenge for a millennium. The fourth season jumps ahead five years, with the Mikaelsons returning to NOLA, and a new, powerful, and ruthless menace set on destroying anything in its path.</p>
